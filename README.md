## Description

This starter kit is a lightweight template for building React.js applications using Vite, designed to streamline the development process. It comes pre-configured with essential tools for a modern frontend workflow.

### Why Vite?

Vite is chosen for its fast build times, optimized development experience, and out-of-the-box support for modern JavaScript features. It significantly reduces the overhead associated with traditional bundlers like Webpack, making it ideal for both small and large-scale projects.
